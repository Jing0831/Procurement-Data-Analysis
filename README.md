# Procurement-Data-Analysis
I am a pre-final year graduate student pursuing an MS degree in Data Analysis. I just finished my MBA this spring with a concentration in Information Technology and this is an independent final project I completed for BAN 265 - PYTHON FOR DATA ANALYSIS. I scraped the data from the NYS OpenData website using selenium in python, and conducted Descriptive Analysis, and performed predictive analysis using the SARIMA model.
